Description of the project:

This code is a modification of OscPocketD/VASynth, created by Staffan Melin, staffan.melin@oscillator.se.
It was later modified by (Steven @moonfriendsynth) to work with the Daisy Pod.
I (Christopher @Nettech15) have modified it further to run on the Daisy Seed without the use of the Daisy Pod board.
Synth parameters are now controlled by a Miditech i2-61 midi keyboard.
Multiple Daisy Seeds will appear as USB-MIDI devices with the name "Daisy Seed Built in" and the device number.
Audio output/input is thru the built-in audio codec.

+ Added Master Tuning, Pitch Bend Wheel, and Pitch Modulation Wheel
+ Upgraded DaisySP with more efficient MoogLadder Filter code.
+ Added PW/PWM square waves.
+ Added Param Switch and Data Entry Slider. 
+ Added QSPI storage for ten user patches. Made ten selectable presets.
+ Added Audio Input PassThru and MIDI indicator. 
+ Added USB-MIDI input.
+ Added Stereo Simulator. 
+ Added Moogladder filter. 
+ Added Dynamic Voice Allocation. 
+ Added keyboard velocity control to VCA and VCF.

Feel free to copy, modify, and improve this code to match your equipment and sound requirements.
In the meantime, I will be actively working on implementing more features and fixing existing problems.
