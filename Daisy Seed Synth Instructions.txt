How to use the Daisy Seed 7-Voice VA Synthesizer:

- Connect audio outputs of the Daisy Seed board to an amp, mixer, or headphones.
- Plug the Daisy Seed board into your computers USB port.
- Run "build_and_program" (or "build_and_program_dfu") task to load the Daisy Seed board with the software.
- Connect a MIDI Keyboard to your computers USB port. I am using a MidiTech i2-61 MIDI controller currently.
- Run VMPK or any MIDI Sequencer software.
- Select "Miditechi2-61" as your MIDI Input device.
- Select "Daisy Seed Built In" as your MIDI Output device.
- If more than one Daisy Seed board is connected, it will appear as device "Daisy Seed Built In #X". Select its board number.
- The default patch loaded on startup is a PolySynth sound.
- Follow the instructions in "Daisy Seed Synth Parameters.txt" to modify parameters, and store user patches.
